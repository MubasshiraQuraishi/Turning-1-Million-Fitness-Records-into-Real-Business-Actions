Recently, I challenged myself by asking ChatGPT to act as a company stakeholder for one day and provide real-world business questions that a data analyst would typically face and need to solve. I found a dataset on Kaggle — it was an extremely large dataset, containing daily fitness records for 3000 users over an entire year. (Now you do the math: over a million records!)

To begin, I first analyzed some key distributions at a dataset-wide level. Then, I grouped and summarized the data based on averages and modes, which made the huge dataset far easier to understand. I also performed user sampling to draw more focused conclusions. Here are the major insights I discovered:

- **Age Groups Walking Most:** Participants aged 18–25 walked the most.
- **Hydration vs. Fitness:** There is no direct positive or negative correlation — hydration alone does not drive better fitness.
- **Smokers vs. Non-Smokers:** Non-smokers are significantly more active, with much higher daily steps.
- **Fitness Level and Sleep:** Sleep duration across fitness levels is quite stable (ranging from 6.8 to 7.2 hours).
- **Stress vs. Daily Steps:** No clear correlation was found between stress level and daily step count.
- **Stress by Gender:** Male and female participants experience nearly the same average stress levels.
- **Hydration vs. Calories Burned:** No specific relationship detected between hydration levels and calories burned.
- **Users at Health Risk:** I identified over 1300 users (based on low heart rate, high weight, and high stress) who are at a potential health risk.

Additionally, key patterns such as the natural decline of heart rate with age, the link between high body weight and higher calories burned, and the direct proportionality of fitness level to exercise duration were also observed.

From this analysis, I recommended actionable strategies for app improvement, such as creating an in-app music feature for young active users, launching a rehab tracker for smokers, and providing mental health resources for users with high stress levels.
